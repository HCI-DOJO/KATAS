KATAS
=====

* Someone passes you a kata. 
* You do the current kata, or elect to chose a new kata and include your project in the solution.
* Tag someone.

If a kata makes it a complete round then the last person to touch it picks a new kata.


You can use any tools you'd like. Solve the kata any way you'd like.
